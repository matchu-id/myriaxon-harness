"""What the system is doing, at eight levels of detail, with a dial rather than a switch.

WHY A DIAL AND NOT A VERBOSE FLAG

A single verbosity flag forces a bad choice. Quiet enough to work in is too quiet to audit; loud enough to
audit buries the answer in noise. The two audiences want different windows on the same stream -- a person
watching a run wants to know it is alive, a person investigating wants to know which bytes it read -- and a
boolean cannot serve both.

So transparency is a LEVEL, 0 to 8, and each level is a strictly richer view of the same underlying events.
Nothing below the level is computed or kept, which is what makes the dial honest: a low setting is genuinely
quiet rather than filtered at display time, and no level can reveal something a higher one hides.

THE EIGHT LAYERS

    0  silent          nothing is emitted at all
    1  pulse           a run exists and is progressing: start, step, heartbeat, end
    2  intent          what the agent says it is about to do, and why -- from the model, untrusted text
    3  actions         which tool was called, with arguments REDACTED by level 4's rules
    4  files           which paths were read and written, and how much changed
    5  system          shell commands, exit codes, and the tail of their output
    6  agents          loci and swarm coordination: who claimed what, who is waiting on whom
    7  decisions       the gates: refusals, confirmations, risk verdicts, budget stops -- including
                       what was REFUSED, which is the half a log usually omits
    8  memory          durable writes: sessions, checkpoints, collective memory, audit entries

LEVEL 7 IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS MOST and the one usually missing. An activity feed that shows only what
happened cannot answer "why did it not do the thing", which is the question people actually arrive with. Every
refusal, every blocked action and every escalation is emitted here with its reason.

WHAT IS NEVER EMITTED AT ANY LEVEL

Credential values. `audit._redact` already knows the shapes, and this reuses it rather than growing a second
opinion about what a secret looks like. A transparency feature that leaks an API key into a UI feed has made the
system worse than opaque, so redaction is applied at EMISSION -- before the event is stored or sent -- rather
than at display, where a second consumer could forget it.

TRUST IS RECORDED, NOT ASSUMED

Everything a model writes is untrusted: a tool argument, a file's contents, a sub-agent's report. Events carry
`trusted: False` for text that came from a model or a file, so a surface can render it as data rather than as
instructions. This is the same rule `tool_catalog` already applies to foreign schemas, applied to the feed.
